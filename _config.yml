  **Hi there ðŸ‘‹**
  
  My name is Clayton Auld. By day, I work in telecommunications 
  as a Network Capacity Forecasting Engineer (prior role was as a Radio Frequency (RF) Engineer). 
  When I'm not at $DAYJOB, I dabble in open source home automation systems, Linux system administration, 
  and network infrastructure. I manage several cloud VPSs using projects like [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net), 
  secure DNS [(DNS-over-TLS)](https://github.com/clayauld/Secure-Adblocking-DNS), and other small things. 
  I also run my own [UnRAID server](https://unraid.net) out of my closet for cloud storage and 
  [home automation](https://home-assistant.io).

  I am an open source software and hardware enthusiast, who loves to play with small embedded systems 
  (think ESP32, STM32, Arduino, etc) for home automation. I believe access to free and open source software 
  is crucial for our society and for the success of modern business and infrastructure. 

  Current favorite projects include:
  * [SkiffOS](https://github.com/skiffos/SkiffOS): Buildroot-based lightweight Linux system for computers and embedded systems. It utilizes Docker containers to decouple the Linux/GNU kernel and BSP from userspace.
  * [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io): Home Automation system on steroids, built to integrate and make dissimilar systems communicate well.
  * [ESPHome](https://esphome.io): A system to control your ESP8266/ESP32 by simple yet powerful configuration files and control them remotely through Home Automation systems.
  * [Home Assistant HACS](https://hacs.xyz/): Home Assistant Community Store
  * [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish): Fish shell

  I am also an avid user of Linux/GNU systems and love the WSL integration into Windows 10.

  Most of my GitHub work centers around home automation, Linux administration, and embedded systems. I have contributed to [SkiffOS](https://github.com/skiffos/SkiffOS) in the form of bug reports and build testing, [Home Assistant HACS](https://hacs.xyz/), and manage the [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) [budspencer theme](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-budspencer) for the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/).

      Alongside my interests in science and technology, some of my other hobbies are:
        - Rock Climbing
        - Cross-country skiing
        - Hiking
        - Fishing - Alaska-style! Not your midwest lake fishing...ðŸ˜†
        - Traveling and nature
      
      I also volunteer with the local search and rescue group, [Alaska Mountain Rescue Group](https://amrg.org/). I am passionate
      about our outdoor spaces, especially here in Alaska, and enjoy giving back a little of my time to our outdoor community while
      helping to increase the chances that fellow adventurers gets home safely.
